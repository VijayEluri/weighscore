The Weighscore ships with a JWS file that may be easily deployed as a
webservice with Apache's Axis. To run Weighscore Neural Server as an Axis
webservice, you should have Axis installed and run. 

Axis is a free opensource web service toolkit. See Axis' homepage,
http://ws.apache.org/axis/ for more information. See Axis documentation found
on that site as well as W3C SOAP specification on webservices on
http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/ to understand details on webservices calling.

To deploy the Neural Network Server as a webservice, perform the following easy
steps:

1) copy weighscore-server.jar into the Axis webapp library directory
(WEB-INF/lib);

2) copy neural.jws file into the Axis webapp (but not to WEB-INF tree);

3) test the webservice by pointing your browser at
http://localhost:8080/axis/neural.jws?wsdl
This will return an XML stream describing the neural webservice. Knowing the
call format, you may now program the webservice SOAP calls with virtually any
platform including Java, .NET, VB, Delphi, Perl, VBScript and many others.
